# plover-clr-trans-state
Adds a Plover command that clears the translation state (useful when switching applications).

## Usage
Add `{plover:clear_trans_state}` as the translation for a chord (recommendation: `KHR-R`).

Chording `KHR-R` will reset the translation state to as if Plover had just started up.
